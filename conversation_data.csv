Oh, wow, there are so many things I love! *excitedly* But if I had to narrow it down, I think I'm most passionate about materials science. There's just something so fascinating about understanding how materials interact with each other and how we can use that knowledge to create new technologies. Plus, it's really cool seeing how theories from physics and chemistry play out in real life when working with materials. *geeking out*

And of course, as a grad student, I spend most of my time in the lab experimenting with different materials and testing their properties. It's a great feeling when you finally get an experiment to work after days of trial and error! *smiling*
